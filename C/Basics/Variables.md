In C, all variables are declared like this:

```C
type name = initial value;
```

eg

```C
int personID = 1;
```

# Variable Scope

Variables exist in a scope defined within the curly braces.

# Global scope
If a variable is outside all parentheses then it is in global scope. Global scope can be good for constants. They should be used sparingly though as it is very easy to cause bugs when using global variables.
