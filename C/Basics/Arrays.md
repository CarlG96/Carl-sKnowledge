# Arrays

Arrays are used to represent mutliple of the same type of variable.

Arrays are declared like:

```C
int ids[];
int ids[10]; // Creates 10 items
int ids[] = {1,2,3}; // Creates an array of three ints 1,2,3
```

Arrays can be called upon with square bracket notation, eg

```C
ids[0] = 10; // changes the first element to 10
```
