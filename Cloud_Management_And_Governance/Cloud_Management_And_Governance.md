# Cloud Management and Governance in Azure

## Group resources by resource group

Allows you to keep security and governance in check, also allows you to make sure that the costs of a resource group are kept to a minimum.

## Resource locks

Resource locks prevent infrastructure from being changed or updated. This can be automated via IaC. They can be ReadOnly or CannotDelete.

## Azure Automation Runbooks

Automate repetitive tasks such as provisioning VMs, scaling up and scaling down resources etc

## Azure Policy

Azure Policy can allow you to add governance policies at a resource group or subscription level.
