## Microsoft Hosted

In Azure Pipelines, the build agent is a virtual machine set up for you that gets discarded after a single job and a new one is set up for the next job.

## Self-hosted agents

Self-hosted agents allow you to install different types of software and will change if the job affects them in any way. The primary reason to run a pipeline using a self-hosted agent is for the flexibility that it can offer you.
