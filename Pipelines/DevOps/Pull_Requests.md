A pull request allows others to know about changes that you have pushed to a branch in the remote repo. It also allows others (who may have the only access rights to the main branch) to review your code before the allowing you to merge it into the main branch/ into another branch.

Pull requests are good as they allow protection of production code but also allow reviewers to add comments for improvement, allow more commits to be added to the pull request and allow others to commit to the branch if need be.
