To get notifications firing based on things happening in Azure DevOps (such as pipeline failures, pull requests etc) you need to configure the connectors from Teams. In the Teams channel you want, click the elipses, click connectors, click Azure DevOps "Configure". From there you can narrow down through projects and teams to get to the pipeline you want with the specific build you want. This will allow you to receive notifications in this channel.
