# Explain the meaning of red-green-refactor

Red-green-refactor are steps in TDD (Test Driven Development) which can lead to well written and tested code.

## Red

The 'Red' part refers to the idea that you should first write a test that asserts what you want to be true but is not currently. This test will then fail, at which point you will move to the green stage.

## Green 

The 'Green' part refers to the idea that you should make the test you originally wrote pass in the most simple manner.

## Refactor

The 'Refactor' part refers to the idea that you should then refactor your code once all the tests are passing. Then you can start the cycle over again either with new tests or by 'tightening up' existing tests.
