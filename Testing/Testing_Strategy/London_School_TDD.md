London School TDD focuses heavily on behaviour testing. There is a heavy emphasis on using mocking and test doubles to check that things are called as you have intended. In London School TDD, generally a class is considered to be the base unit of a unit test. This approach allows you to keep the codebase smaller by removing redundant code. A downside to London School is that tests break easily when refactoring is performed, meaning refactoring can take longer however a plus to this is that breaks in your tests will become obvious very quickly, allowing for you to make corrections. 

London School TDD's biggest advantage over Detroit School TDD is that when you can't assert for the end state (or it would be incredibly difficult to) such as an API call you can at least know the call was made as you intended.
