The Detroit School of Test Driven Development focuses heavily on state testing. Unlike London school TDD, a single class is not always considered to be a single unit in regards to unit tests, but can be multiple related classes grouped together. Detroit School allows for heavy refactoring of code that does not necessarily break tests as the units become decoupled from eachother. For example, you could have two adaptor/ port units that share interfaces but have different functionality depending on where they are intending to send data. With London School TDD, you would have to extensively refactor tests to change out adaptor/ports but with Detroit School TDD this becomes an easy thing to do, as the two units will probably have their own state tests. 

A downside to Detroit School TDD is the fact that you can easily break the YAGNI principle by overengineering before things are needed.
