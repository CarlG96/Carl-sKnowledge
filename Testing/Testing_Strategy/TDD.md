## Acronym

TDD stands for Test Driven Development.

## Meaning

Test Driven Development is a way of developing software where you write the tests BEFORE you write the functioning code. This allows you to assert exactly what you want before writing the test and then make sure that you write the code that makes the test pass. Methods such as the three As and red-green-refactor are used during TDD. It also means that when you have a working piece of code you have already written the automated tests which is helpful. 

Test Driven Development also ensures that each feature developed is small and incremental, preventing unfathomable bugs from being introduced into the codebase without being thoroughly tested.
