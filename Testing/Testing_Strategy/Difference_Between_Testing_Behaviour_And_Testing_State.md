The difference between testing behaviour and testing state is that testing behaviour checks to see if something has happened whereas testing state is concerned with whether or not the intended outcome has been acheived. For example, say you have a Maths class that has a set of classes as properties fthat handle mathematical. If you have an Addition class in the Maths class then you could write a test checking that a method of the Addition class adds the numbers 1 and 2  correctly. That would be testing state. On the other hand, could substitute the Addition class with a SpyAddition class which would return a message when called upon to add numbers by the Maths class to check that it is being called correctly. This would be testing behaviour.

In summary, behaviour testing is concerned with IF something happened whereas state testing is concerned WHAT happened. Behaviour testing is good for checking that the code logic is executing in the order you expect it to and state testing is good for checking that that logic is doing what you expect it to do.
