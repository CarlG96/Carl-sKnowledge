System tests or end-to-end tests are tests that occur at the end of the testing cycle (although the requirements for them could be written at the start of the testing cycle, with an eye to eventually passing them). They test all the functional and non-functional capabilities of the system as a whole as it would work in the real world, and is therefore mostly concerned with delivering to the customer. Systems testing would not use mocking or substitutes as it is meant to replicate real-world capability and to check that after specific intergration tests are carried out that ALL of the components of the system end up working together. Systems tests can also have subjective elements such as design and user experience (UX) which can be hard to define in code and for this reason this stage often involves talking to the customer.
