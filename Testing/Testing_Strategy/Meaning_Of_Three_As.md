The three As stand for Arrange, Act, Assert and it is a practice in development. It can be worked backwards from in order to get the best results if you have a good IDE like VS with ReSharper.

## Arrange
In this phase, you instantiate and otherwise setup the variables you need for your test to be run.

## Act
In this phase, methods are called and behaviour is carried out.

## Assert 
This is where you assert what you want to be true after the actions have been carried out. This is where you will find out if your tests have passed or not.
