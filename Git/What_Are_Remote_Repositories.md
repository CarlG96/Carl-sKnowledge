# Explain the concept of a remote repository

A remote repository is a git repository that is used to store version controlled documents. It is different from a local repository as it is often used as a backup for the local repository. The reason you would want a remote repository is that if your local repository was lost or damaged in some way then you would have a back up at the remote repository from which you could restore your work. Sites such as GitHub or Azure DevOps allow you to store a remote repository in the cloud.

Git defines them like so: `Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you.`
