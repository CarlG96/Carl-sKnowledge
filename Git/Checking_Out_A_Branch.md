# Explain the concept of checking out a branch

Using git branch you can see all of the local branches of the current repo.

Using git branch [ branch-name ] you can create new branches so that you can do work separately to the main branch, meaning multiple people can work on the same project without interfering with eachother or test something without potentially breaking lots of things as the branch could simply be discarded if it all goes wrong.

Using git checkout [ branch-name ] will switchh you to that branch.

Using git checkout -b [ branch name ] will allow you simultaneously create and checkout to a branch.
