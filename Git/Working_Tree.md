The Working Tree or the Working Directory is the directory of source files that you see and edit and includes the .git folder but the .git folder is not considered part of the working tree as it contains the Index and the local repository. When you stage files with the 'git add' command they are moved from the working tree to the Index before they are commited to the local repository which stores the versions of all versions of every file in the repo as a compressed blob file.

The Working Tree is located on your file system.
