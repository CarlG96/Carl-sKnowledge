A local repository refers to the git repository on your own computer or the computers of your team members. Staging, committing and checking statuses etc happen in the local repository. The local repository is in contrast to the remote repository, which is usually stored on a cloud-based platform such as GitHub or Azure DevOps. If you are the only one working on your work and don't want a remote backup, arguably a local git repository is all you need.
