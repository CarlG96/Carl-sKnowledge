There are many similarities and differences between abstract classes and interfaces. 

## Similarities
-Cannot be instantiated
-Inherited/ implemented by classes that take their methods/ properties
-Used as a general "base class" for other classes.

## Differences
-Interfaces cannot have fields, abstract classes can
-Interfaces cannot have bodies on their methods, abstract classes can

Basically, interfaces allow you to define functionality and are more flexible from the base, whereas abstract classes allow you to implement functionality from the base but gaining flexibility with it is annoying.
