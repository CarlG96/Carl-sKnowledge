## XP meaning

XP stands for eXtreme Programming.

## Values of XP

### Communication

Extreme programming says that communication is inherent to programming. It emphasises how people should speak to each other so that knowledge is passed around the team and people are better informed and better decisions are made.

### Simplicity

Extreme programming says that things should be kept as simple as possible. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) is a big principle. Don't try and predict the future.

### Feedback

Extreme programming says that feedback is important for improving team practices. Feedback also allows you to improve practices in your team. Feedback also improves your software, and when combined with the simplicity principle, ensures your software grows organically.

### Courage

Courage allows you to raise concerns about things that aren't working. It also allows you to take feedback and board and change direction if what you are doing is not currently working.

### Respect

Respect allows you to work well with your team mates. It means that people feel like they can give feedback and raise concerns where they arise.

## Process Cycle

The life cycle in XP is the time required to complete a project.
The first process is planning, where the customer asks for certain things and the team and developers start estimating how long that will take, how many iterations it will take and start turning the work into tasks.
The second process is designing, where simple designs are created by the developers.
The third process is coding, where the design is implemented into actual workable code.
The fourth process is testing, which is often done during the coding phase aswell (in the case of TDD).
The fifth process is listening, where the team listen to whether or not the customer finds the product acceptable.
