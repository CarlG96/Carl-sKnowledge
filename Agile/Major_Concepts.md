Opposed to Waterfall delivery, less of a top down approach and more of a feedback loops approach.

## Agile principles

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working solutions over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

Although all of the ones on the right are good ideas, the ideas on the left trump them in terms of importance.

Agile allows teams to pivot when needed, and find out what works and what doesn't as the software is being developed as opposed to releasing software with poor UX and bugs after everything has been done. This is almost like testing in a general sense, ensuring that the customer is happy with your product.

In agile, there is often a product owner who communicates with the customer and decides on what work will be done based on the feedback they hear from the customer. Agile is focused on continuous delivery of the product.
