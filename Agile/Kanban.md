Kanban, is an agile framework in which there is a focus on finishing the current work over starting new work. The idea of a Kanban board is where there are multiple items that are in separate categories such as 'ToDo', 'Working on' 'Complete' etc and items move from one part of the board to the other as they are worked on. 

In Kanban, planning is more of a rolling wave, with each wave having a number of items that need to be completed. These items need to be limited in nature due so that the team knows what they have to work on currently and finish before taking on new work. This limited approach also allows a shift in work to occur should changes be needed. This approach differs from Scrum in that the items need to be finished before the next 'wave' whereas a 'sprint' in Scrum is a definite period of time.

Kanban principles that are often espoused are:

1) Start With What You Do Now - continue your workflow now and as problems emerge fix them.
2) Agree to Pursue Incremental, Evolutionary Change - improve things as you go along.
3) Encourage Acts of Leadership at All Levels - this encourages people to voice their ideas.
4) Focus on Customer's Needs and Expectations - Standard Agile principle.
5) Manage the Work, not the Workers - trust people to understand what they need to do.
6) Regularly Review the Network of Services - Constantly adjust based on feedback.
