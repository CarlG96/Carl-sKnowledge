# Explain the major concepts of Lean

Lean is a way of looking at work. It aims to reduce waste and increase productivity. There are five principles in Lean:

1) Value - This is determined from the perspective of the customer, and you should try to make the most value for the customer at the smallest price therefore minimising waste and maximising profit (or reduction in resources used from an OS perspective).

2) Evaluate - Work out the steps needed to produce the product (or piece of software) and try and minimise waste (or time wastage). Anything that slows down or doesn't add value should be removed. This step won't be perfect but can reduce the amount of waste in the future.

3) Flow - Try to remove barriers that would prevent work (an example in Common Engineering might be permissions for Azure or secrets being hard to share or software not working correctly).

4) Pull - Only commence work when there is a demand, as opposed to pushing work. In an OS sense that might mean not trying to preempt certain things and allowing it to happen organically as a need arises in the business.

5) Perfection - Continually refine your methods and processes in order to make them better and less wasteful. Maybe if software was developed first and then testing took ages after the fact Test-Driven Development might be the way you start your next project so the startup might be slower but the actual creation of the software will be far easier further along in development.
