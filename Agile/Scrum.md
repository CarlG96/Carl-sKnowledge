Standup meetings, in which people discuss what work there is to carry out. These meetings are designed to be short and people are encouraged to be honest so that the team can adapt to any problems tahtare occuring.

Sprints - Usually 2 weeks long but can be shorter or longer depending on the team. An estimate of how many 'story points' can be performed by the team is given and work is assigned based on that. Burndown charts are used to track how much progress has been made. An important part of sprints is that they do not change length even if the work is not finished, so the team can have an honest indicator of their progress.

Retros - Evaluations at the end of the sprint about how improvements could be made, what went well/ wrong etc
