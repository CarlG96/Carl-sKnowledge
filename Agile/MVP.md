MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. In software development, it is used to describe a piece of software that has just enough features to work correctly but not an exhaustive list. This piece of software is then given to early adopters who are can then provide feedback in order to help drive development of the software. This is helpful when developing software as it allows the developers to understand exactly where their focus should be, as their expectations of what and how important features are to the users may be way off base or there may be unforeseen bugs that become apparent when the product is deployed. 

Releasing an MVP is good for Agile methods of working and incremental development because it prevents wasted time on features that aren't wanted. It also means that time is saved if the piece of software is completely unwanted as many of the features will not be fully fleshed out or even in production by the time it is created, meaning that losses of time and/or money are minimal.
