PowerShell Gallery is an online central repository for sharing and acquiring PowerShell code including PowerShell modules, scripts and DSC resources. One thing to note is that Microsoft does not quality control PowerShell Gallery even though they maintain it, so caution is needed when downloading anything.

PowerShell Gallery is great for finding code that others have already written to perform tasks.
