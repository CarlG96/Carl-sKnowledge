## What is Get-Help in PowerShell?

Because PowerShell has thousands of commands, it is almost impossible to remember all of them. Get-Help can give you Comment-Based Help which will allow you to understand functions and how to use them, what parameters they take etc. You can use Get-Help like this:

```PowerShell
get-help get-process
```
Would return Comment-Based Help on the Get-Process function

Sometimes you'll need to append either -Full or -Online to the end of help to retrieve the full Comment-Based help or open a browser to find something online. You can also run Update-Help to update what Get-Help returns on your local machine, for example:

```PowerShell
update-help -Module Microsoft.PowerShell*
```
would return an updated version of help for any modules that begin with Microsoft.PowerShell.

## What is Comment-Based Help?
Comment-Based Help is a way of commenting your functions so that people will find them easy to use by running the Get-Help Command. Some of the things like syntax are autogenerated but some aren't.

## How to do Comment-Based Help with example

Here's a PowerShell script for running a simple dice game.
```PowerShell
function start-dicegame {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$firstPlayerName,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$secondPlayerName
    )
    $Generator = New-Object System.Random

	$firstPlayerDiceRoll = [int]$Generator.next(1, 12)
    $secondPlayerDiceRoll = [int]$Generator.next(1, 12)

    Write-Host "First player's roll was $firstPlayerDiceRoll"
    Write-Host "Second player's roll was $secondPlayerDiceRoll"
    if($firstPlayerDiceRoll -gt $secondPlayerDiceRoll)
    {
        Write-Host "$firstPlayerName wins!"
    }
    elseif ($secondPlayerDiceRoll -gt $firstPlayerDiceRoll) {
        Write-Host "$secondPlayerName wins!"
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "Draw!"
    }
}

start-dicegame
```

With Comment-Based Help you can put comments at the top of the script or function. I had to refactor to make this work in the script so moved the params out to the top of the file.

```PowerShell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Plays a dice game
.Description
Plays a dice game, run the script by calling the filepath, you can then choose names
.Example
If in the scripts directory, call ./dicegame.ps1 to run it

.Parameter firstPlayerName
First player's name : string
.Parameter secondPlayerName
Second player's name : string


#>


param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$firstPlayerName,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$secondPlayerName
    )


function start-dicegame {
    $Generator = New-Object System.Random

	$firstPlayerDiceRoll = [int]$Generator.next(1, 12)
    $secondPlayerDiceRoll = [int]$Generator.next(1, 12)

    Write-Host "First player's roll was $firstPlayerDiceRoll"
    Write-Host "Second player's roll was $secondPlayerDiceRoll"
    if($firstPlayerDiceRoll -gt $secondPlayerDiceRoll)
    {
        Write-Host "$firstPlayerName wins!"
    }
    elseif ($secondPlayerDiceRoll -gt $firstPlayerDiceRoll) {
        Write-Host "$secondPlayerName wins!"
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "Draw!"
    }
}

start-dicegame
```

Produces this output when using Get-Help and the -Full parameter.
