In the teams channel, go to the elipses in the top right hand corner.

Click configure for Azure Devops.

Select your account

Select the organisation

Select the project and team (upport Users for me usually)

Select the event type (for failures you need to select the build completed first)

For build definition select the pipeline being used

For the build status, set what you want to happen (can be failed here)

Check the DevOps project service hooks and it should be in there.
