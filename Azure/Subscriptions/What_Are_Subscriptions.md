Subscriptions are containers that contain business or technical resources in Azure. Subscriptions can be thought of like a billing bucket in which everything can be put into. 

At OS, currently the Systems are split across multiple different subscriptions in Azure and make up the first four letters of any resource group name. Under subscriptions are the OS invented Environments, which make up the second four letters of any resource group name. Under environments are the resource groups themselves.

A subscription accrues costs based on the cloud-resources used. A subscription is linked to an Azure account. A subscription has a trust relationship with an Azure Active Directory instance which handles authentication and authorisation for service principals and devices.
