Table Entities in Table Storage each have a RowKey, a PartitionKey and a TimeStamp property. The RowKey and PartitionKey make up the primary key of the TableEntity and the TimeStamp represents the last time the table entity was updated. The PartitionKey represents which partition in the table the specific Table Entity belongs to and the RowKey is a unique id within that partition, together they create a unique id for the Table Entity's primary key. Partitions are useful for Table Storage because they allow it to be scalable.
