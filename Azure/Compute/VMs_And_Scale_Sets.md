# Virtual Machines and Scale Sets

Virtual machines can be provisioned on Azure, they have an OS image and disks that can be attached to them.

## Scale Sets

Virtual Machine Scale Sets allow you to deploy, run and manage a scalable set of identical VMs. This solution allows for autoscaling (as well as manual scaling). Can be done automatically or manually. Autoscaling can be done both vertically (beefier VMs) or horizontally (more VMs).
