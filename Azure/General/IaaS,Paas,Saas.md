# Types of Service Model

## On Premises

Everything is handled on prem. Most control, most expense/ risk.

## Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service)

Moves the virtualisation, servers, storage and networking to the cloud.

## Paas (Platform as a Service)

On top of the Iaas stuff, moves the O/S, middleware and runtime to the cloud.

## Saas (Software as a Service)

On top of the PaaS stuff, moves the data and application/ software side of things to the cloud. Least control, least expense/risk.

# Serverless

Cloud handles infrastructure, devs write code.
