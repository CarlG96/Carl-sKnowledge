Dependency Injection is the idea that you provide an object the objects that it needs to be constructed without having it construct them itself. This is useful in testing. One way in which this is useful in testing is that allows for the mocking and stubbing of objects which can lead to more accurate behaviour tests. Outside of London School TDD, it can lead to isolating the components in a system and this loose coupling can allow for easily refactored code if one class needs to be substituted for another in development. 

To use an example, a TV remote requires batteries. If we assume Duracell and Energizer are two different classes that implement from an IBattery interface, then if the batteries are not constructed in the TV remote class, then they can be dependency injected into it, meaning that you could use either the Duracell or Energizer batteries depending on the circumstance. The opposite of this would be the TV remote always constructing a Duracell battery at construction time.
