ETC stands for Easy To Change. It is synonymous with maintainable code. 

Maintainable code is the practice of asking yourself: "Is this code easy to change?". Making code easy to change ensures that future maintainers will be able to refactor the code when new features need to be implemented or bugs need to be fixed. It also helps to implement other key software principles such as:

- Loose coupling
- Simplicity
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Single Responsibility Principle (along with the other SOLID principles)
