Separations of Concerns is that functions and classes should do one well defined bit of functionality. For example, if you had a Maths class that had hundreds of methods, it might be better to break it up into smaller classes ie Trig class, Calc class, Geometry class and in those classes each Method should do one thing. This helps with testing as it allows you to easily make tests that are very specific.
